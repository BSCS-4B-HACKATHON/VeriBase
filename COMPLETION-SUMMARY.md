# 🎉 Complete! Here's What You Have

## ✅ Smart Contract Revision - Complete

### What Was Accomplished

I've completely revised your smart contract system from the original `ProofNFT` to a comprehensive three-contract architecture matching your database schema exactly.

  requesterWallet: string; // ✅ Used for minting recipient
  documents: DocMeta[]; // ✅ Maps to token metadata array

This file has been archived. The complete project overview and documentation have been consolidated into `README.md` at the repository root.
Please open `README.md` for the current project summary, deploy addresses, and next steps.
function safeMint(address to, DocMeta[] memory metadata)
    → One NFT per wallet
    → Stores all DocMeta[]
    → Non-transferable
```

**Land Ownership Requests (`requestType: 'land_ownership'`):**

```solidity
// Mint LandOwnershipNFT
function safeMint(address to, DocMeta[] memory metadata)
    → Multiple NFTs per wallet
    → Stores all DocMeta[]
    → Transferable via contract only
```

---

## 🔄 How It Works End-to-End

### Minting Flow

```
1. User submits request
   ↓
2. Backend stores in MongoDB
   DocMeta[] = [
     {label: "full_name", value: "encrypted_xyz", encrypted: true},
     {label: "id_number", value: "encrypted_abc", encrypted: true}
   ]
   ↓
3. Admin verifies request
   ↓
4. Backend calls smart contract:
   if (requestType === 'national_id') {
     nationalIdNFT.safeMint(requesterWallet, documents)
   } else if (requestType === 'land_ownership') {
     landOwnershipNFT.safeMint(requesterWallet, documents)
   }
   ↓
5. Smart contract mints NFT
   ↓
6. Backend updates request with tokenId and txHash
   ↓
7. User sees NFT in wallet
```

### Transfer Flow (Land Only)

```
1. Seller owns LandOwnershipNFT
   ↓
2. Seller initiates transfer:
   landTransferContract.initiateTransfer(
     tokenId, buyer, price, duration, legalDocCid
   )
   ↓
3. NFT locked (can't be transferred elsewhere)
   ↓
4. Buyer deposits escrow:
   landTransferContract.depositEscrow(transferId) {value: price}
   ↓
5. Admin verifies legal documents off-chain
   ↓
6. Admin completes transfer:
   landTransferContract.completeTransfer(transferId)
   ↓
7. Contract executes:
   - Calculates fee (2.5%)
   - Transfers NFT to buyer
   - Sends 97.5% to seller
   - Sends 2.5% to fee collector
   - Refunds excess escrow
```

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

### Prerequisites Checklist

- ✅ Smart contracts compiled and ready
- ✅ Deployment script with auto-authorization
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Old files cleaned up
- ✅ Architecture matches database schema

### What You Need

**To Deploy:**

1. Base Sepolia test ETH ([get from faucet](https://docs.base.org/docs/tools/network-faucets))
2. Private key with funds
3. 5 minutes to run deployment

**Deploy Command:**

```bash
cd base_own/blockchain
echo "BASE_SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY=0x..." > .env
npx hardhat run scripts/deployNFTs.ts --network baseSepolia
```

**That's it!** The script will:

- ✅ Deploy NationalIdNFT
- ✅ Deploy LandOwnershipNFT
- ✅ Deploy LandTransferContract
- ✅ Authorize transfer contract
- ✅ Save all addresses to JSON

## 🎨 What's Different from ProofNFT

### Old System (ProofNFT)

```
❌ Single contract for all document types
❌ Hash-based storage only

❌ No distinction between identity and property
❌ Direct transfers allowed
```

### New System (3 Contracts)

```
✅ Separate contracts for different use cases
✅ Full metadata storage with encryption flags
✅ Escrow-based transfer system with fees
✅ Identity NFTs are soul-bound
✅ Property NFTs require authorized contract
✅ Legal compliance with IPFS document linking
```
