### Solutions Applied:

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Still getting 'already has NFT' error"
- Make sure you restarted both client AND server
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check you're using the NEW contract addresses
- Verify in browser console that correct addresses are loaded

### "Transaction fails"
- Check you have enough testnet ETH (0.001 ETH minimum)
- Verify you're on Base Sepolia network
- Check MetaMask didn't hit rate limit (wait 2-3 minutes)

### "Can't see my NFT"
- Check BaseScan: https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/YOUR_WALLET
- NFT might take 10-20 seconds to index
- Make sure transaction confirmed (green checkmark)
