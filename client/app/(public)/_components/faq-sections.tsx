      question: "What is VeriBase exactly?",
      answer:
        "VeriBase is a blockchain-powered verification platform that secures land titles and national IDs on-chain. We convert your documents into cryptographic fingerprints (hashes) that are immutable, tamper-proof, and verifiable — without exposing sensitive information publicly.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the verification process work?",
      answer:
        "Simply connect your wallet, submit your document for verification, and upload the required files. Our system verifies authenticity through admin approval, then mints an NFT representing your ownership. The entire process takes under 2 minutes once approved, and everything is secured on the blockchain.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is my personal information safe and private?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. We use cryptographic hashing to create document fingerprints — meaning your actual documents are never stored on-chain. Only the hash (a unique digital signature) is recorded, making your data verifiable without being publicly visible. Your documents are encrypted and stored securely off-chain.",
    },
    {
      question: "What can I do with my verified NFT?",
      answer:
        "Your verification NFT serves as proof of ownership that's permanently recorded on the blockchain. You can transfer it to others, use it for legal verification, present it to institutions, or keep it as immutable proof of your land title or national ID. It's yours forever — tamper-proof and always accessible.",
    },
    {
      question: "What blockchain does VeriBase use?",
      answer:
        "VeriBase is deployed on Base Sepolia (testnet), an Ethereum Layer 2 solution that offers fast transactions, low gas costs, and high security. This means you get the benefits of Ethereum's security with significantly lower fees and faster confirmation times.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need cryptocurrency to use VeriBase?",
      answer:
        "Yes, you'll need a small amount of ETH on the Base Sepolia network to cover gas fees for minting your verification NFT. However, the costs are minimal thanks to Layer 2 optimization. We've designed the platform to be as cost-effective as possible while maintaining top-tier security.",
