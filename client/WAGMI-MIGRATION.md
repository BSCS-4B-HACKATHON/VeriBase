# Wagmi Migration Complete ðŸŽ‰

## What Changed

Successfully migrated from custom wallet connection logic to **Wagmi v2** with the latest Viem. This eliminates the janky behavior where Phantom wallet was popping up when trying to connect to MetaMask.

## Key Benefits

1. **No More Phantom Popup** - Wagmi properly isolates wallet connectors
2. **Better Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support with proper types
3. **Automatic State Management** - React Query handles caching and updates
4. **Cleaner Code** - Removed ~300 lines of custom wallet management code
5. **Better Maintained** - Wagmi is actively maintained by the Ethereum community

## Files Changed

### New Files Created

- `lib/wagmi.ts` - Wagmi configuration with MetaMask and Coinbase connectors
- `app/providers.tsx` - React Query and Wagmi providers wrapper
- `hooks/useWallet.ts` - Compatibility hook for existing components

### Files Updated

- `app/layout.tsx` - Now uses new Providers instead of WalletProvider
- `components/connect-wallet.tsx` - Now uses Wagmi hooks (useAccount, useConnect, useDisconnect)
- `components/disconnect-button.tsx` - Updated import path
- `components/nav-user.tsx` - Updated import path
- `app/(user)/requests/[id]/page.tsx` - Updated import path
- `app/(user)/requests/page.tsx` - Updated import path
- `app/(user)/home/page.tsx` - Updated import path
- `app/(user)/requests/new/page.tsx` - Updated import path

### Files That Can Be Deleted (Optional)

- `app/context/walletContext.tsx` - No longer needed (replaced by Wagmi)

## Technical Details

### Wagmi Configuration (`lib/wagmi.ts`)

```typescript
- Chain: Base Sepolia
- Connectors: MetaMask SDK, Coinbase Wallet SDK
- Transport: HTTP (default RPC)
- SSR: Enabled for Next.js
```

### Connector IDs

- MetaMask: `"metaMaskSDK"`
- Coinbase: `"coinbaseWalletSDK"`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Connect with MetaMask (no Phantom popup)
- [ ] Connect with Coinbase Wallet
- [ ] Disconnect wallet
- [ ] Copy wallet address
- [ ] View on BaseScan
- [ ] Navigation between pages maintains connection
- [ ] Refresh page maintains connection
- [ ] Submit requests with connected wallet

## Migration Notes

The `hooks/useWallet.ts` file provides a compatibility layer that mimics the old API, so existing components didn't need major refactoring. This made the migration smoother.

If you want to fully embrace Wagmi, you can replace direct `useWallet()` calls with native Wagmi hooks:

- `useAccount()` for address and connection status
- `useConnect()` for connecting wallets
- `useDisconnect()` for disconnecting
- `useWalletClient()` for signing transactions

## Package Versions Installed

```json
{
  "wagmi": "^2.18.0",
  "viem": "^2.38.2",
  "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.90.3"
}
```

All packages are using the latest stable versions as of the migration date.
