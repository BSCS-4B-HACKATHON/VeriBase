# SECURITY.md Update Summary

## ✅ What Was Updated

The `SECURITY.md` file has been completely revised to reflect your new NFT architecture.

### Old (Deleted) ❌

- **ProofNFT** references
- Hash-based proof system
- Preimage/rainbow table attack discussions
- Single contract focus

### New (Updated) ✅

- **NationalIdNFT** (soul-bound identity NFT)
- **LandOwnershipNFT** (transferable property NFT)
- **LandTransferContract** (authorized transfer mechanism)
- File encryption with IPFS
- Metadata structure documentation
- Transfer restriction security
- Delete-after-mint paradigm

---

## 📋 Key Security Features Documented

### NationalIdNFT Security

1. ✅ **Soul-bound**: Cannot be transferred (enforced at contract level)
2. ✅ **One per wallet**: Prevents duplicate identity NFTs
3. ✅ **Immutable ownership**: Once minted, identity is permanent
4. ✅ **Revocation mechanism**: Owner can revoke compromised NFTs

### LandOwnershipNFT Security

1. ✅ **Transfer restrictions**: Only via authorized LandTransferContract
2. ✅ **Multiple NFTs allowed**: Users can own multiple properties
3. ✅ **Fee mechanism**: Transfers include configurable fees
4. ✅ **Revocation support**: Owner can revoke fraudulent tokens

### File Encryption

1. ✅ **AES-256-GCM**: Industry-standard encryption
2. ✅ **IPFS storage**: Encrypted files stored off-chain
3. ✅ **Hash storage**: Only ciphertext hashes on blockchain
4. ✅ **Key management**: Encryption keys never touch blockchain

---

## 🛡️ Threat Analysis Coverage

### Covered Threats

- ✅ File encryption security (AES-256-GCM)
- ✅ Soul-bound NFT restrictions (transfer prevention)
- ✅ One-NFT-per-wallet enforcement
- ✅ Unauthorized land transfers (contract-only transfers)
- ✅ Owner key compromise (multi-sig recommendations)
- ✅ IPFS availability (redundant pinning)
- ✅ Metadata immutability (design trade-offs)

### Mitigation Strategies

- File encryption before IPFS upload
- Smart contract-level transfer restrictions
- Mapping-based duplicate prevention
- Authorized contract pattern
- HSM/multi-sig for owner keys
- Multiple IPFS pinning services

## 📚 Best Practices Documented

### 1. File Encryption

```typescript
// Complete code example for AES-256-GCM encryption
async function encryptFile(fileBuffer, password) {
  // Key derivation, IV generation, encryption
}
```

### 2. Server-Side Verification

```typescript
// Complete workflow:
// 1. Verify request exists
// 2. Check verification status
// 3. Validate wallet ownership
// 4. Mint NFT
// 5. Delete request from database
```

### 3. Metadata Structure

```typescript
interface DocMeta {
  label: string; // Filename or field name
  value: string; // Hash or value
  encrypted: boolean; // Encryption flag
}
```

### 4. Batch Minting

```typescript
// Gas optimization with 50-NFT batches
async function batchMintLandNFTs(requests) {
  // Batch processing logic
}
```

### 5. Event Monitoring

```typescript
// Real-time monitoring for security events
nationalIdNFT.watchEvent.NationalIdMinted({...});
landOwnershipNFT.watchEvent.TokenRevoked({...});
```

## 🔧 Recommended Enhancements

### Documented Upgrades

1. **Multi-Signature Minting** - Role-based access control
2. **Enhanced Revocation** - Appeal mechanism for disputes
3. **Time-Limited Verification** - Expiration dates for documents
4. **Dynamic Transfer Fees** - Adjustable fee rates
5. **Emergency Pause** - Pausable functionality
6. **Verification Registry** - Separate tracking contract

---

## 🔒 Privacy Considerations

### What's Public

- Wallet addresses
- Document types and names
- IPFS CIDs (encrypted files)
- Ciphertext hashes
- Minting timestamps

### What's Private

- File contents (encrypted)
- Encryption keys
- Decryption passwords
- Raw document data

### Privacy Strategies

- Minimal document names
- Separate wallets per document type
- Encrypted filenames in metadata
- Off-chain verification options
